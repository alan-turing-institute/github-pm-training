Theory Session 2: Agile Ceremonies
==================================

Scrum
-----

Up to now we've been considering Agile in general.

We're now going to cover in more detail one of the leading standard formal
agile processes, Scrum. This is a useful starting point for a new agile team.
But remember, you own your own process, as a team. View the Scrum template
as a starting point for your own **adopt and adapt** process, and make it work
for you. (But when you change it, write down your changes.)

Scrum is not the only choice for a specific process
that meets the agile philosophy. **Kanban** is another interesting choice.

Roles in Scrum
--------------

While no one 'manages' a
self-organising team in an
agile project, Scrum identifies a couple of special responsibilities as helpful
to productive teams.

The **Scrum Master** organises the agile process. They
are accountable for ensuring the process is followed. They chair the meetings,
and verify that tickets are up to date and complete. (Though everyone is
responsible for their own tickets.)

The **Product Owner** ensures that the team is delivering functionality that
meets the project's priorities. They arbitrate in the event of lack of
consensus between stakeholders or contributors.

Scrum also makes a clear separation between the core project team, who
are responsible or accountable for the project, from other stakeholders,
who are consulted or informed.

Meetings in agile
-----------------

We all know we have too many meetings. Agile approaches achieve efficiency
by defining a series of specific meetings within the process, reducing
the number of other meetings.

Scrum defines four, which we will discuss in turn:

Sprint Planning Meeting
-----------------------

* Decide which issues from the backlog should be put into the sprint
* Decide who will work on which issues
* Affirm that the team agree that issues are of reasonable size to be completed,
  or break them down.

(Typically 1-2 hours)

Demo meeting
------------

* Demonstrate functionality from the sprint to stakeholders outside the
  core project team.
* Receive input which may result in new issues for the backlog.
* Formally the only meeting which invites members not of the core project team.

(Typically 30 minutes.)

Sprint Retrospective
--------------------

* Note any issues that were not completed, and understand why.
* Resolve on any changes to the process needed.

(Typically 1 hour, often co-scheduled with the retrospective.)

Daily standup
-------------

* What did I complete yesterday?
* What will I work on today?
* Am I blocked by anything?

(Maximum 15 minutes, often shorter.)

For distributed teams, we can use 'geekbot' to help run this meeting via Slack.
