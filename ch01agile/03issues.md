# Practical Session 1: Issue Tracking In Github
=============================================

In groups of four, trainees should form teams to work on a pretend project.

The instructor will guide the class to:

* Create accounts in Github
* Create a repository
* Add collaborators and repositories to teams
* Add **Issues** to the Repository
  * Manage **Tags** for Issues
  * Assign issues to team members
  * Make sub-issues with `- [ ]`
  * Reference other issues with `#NNN`
* Create a project board
  * Assign columns to a project board
  * Move issues between columns
