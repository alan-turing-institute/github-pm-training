# MPHYG001: An Introduction to Agile Project Management with Github

##Introduction

We will teach how to manage a backlog of tasks via short working 'sprints', and coordinate a team through regular 'scrums'. The history and philosophy of Agile Development and its application to non-programming projects will be considered.The session will cover using Markdown to co-author documents in a distributed fashion and the basics of version control.
You'll use the web-based GitHub interface for non-programmers and learn to use GitHub Flow so that contributions can be easily reviewed and accepted.

##Pre-requisites

Trainees should bring a web-connected laptop device for this hands-on practical tutorial.

Please note, coding experience is not required to take part.
